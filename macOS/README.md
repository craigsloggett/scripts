### Setup

Run the setup script from this repository using the following command:

```shell
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/craigsloggett/scripts/refs/heads/macOS/macOS/install.sh" | sh
```

### Homebrew

Install the Homebrew package manager with the following command:

```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

### Developer Directory

Create a _Developer_ directory in the `$HOME` folder:

```shell
mkdir -p ~/Developer
```

### Hosts File

Add the configuration and secrets server to `/etc/hosts`:

```shell
sudo vi /etc/hosts
# Add the IP address and hostname to the end of this file.
```

## Configure SSH

First, create an SSH key:

```shell
ssh-keygen -t ed25519
```

Then copy the SSH key to the server containing the rest of the configuration:

```shell
ssh-copy-id user@my-server
```

## Install GnuPG and Import Keys

**Requires:**
 - `ssh`

Install `gnupg` with Homebrew:

```shell
brew install gnupg
```

Copy GPG keys from the server containing the required secret (sub)keys:

```shell
scp user@my-server:/key/directory/secret-subkeys.gpg ~/Desktop
```

Create the configuration directory, then import the GPG keys:

```shell
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/gnupg
chmod 700 ~/.local/share/gnupg
GNUPGHOME=~/.local/share/gnupg gpg --import ~/Desktop/secret-subkeys.gpg
```

## Install Pass and Git Clone the Password Store

**Requires:**
 - `ssh`
 - `gnupg`

Install `pass` with Homebrew:

```shell
brew install pass
```

Clone the password store from the server containing the repository:

```shell
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/pass
chmod 700 ~/.local/share/pass
git clone user@my-server:/pass/directory/password-store.git ~/.local/share/pass
```

Test `pass` works:

```shell
GNUPGHOME=~/.local/share/gnupg PASSWORD_STORE_DIR=~/.local/share/pass pass
```

## Install and Configure Firefox

Install **Firefox** with Homebrew:

```shell
brew install --cask firefox
```

In order to install the Firefox configuration, you need to grant Full Disk Access to Terminal:

`System Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Full Disk Access`

Following this, create a `distribution` folder:

```shell
mkdir /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/Resources/distribution
```

Copy the `policies.json` file from the configuration server:

```shell
scp user@my-server:/backup/directory/policies.json /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/Resources/distribution
```

Remove Full Disk Access for the Terminal:

`System Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Full Disk Access`

Firefox will create a profile directory for the user the first time is it opened. This will be overwritten with a `user.js` file with custom configuration. Open Firefox and then close it right away.

Copy the `user.js` file from the configuration server:

```shell
scp user@my-server:/backup/directory/user.js ~/Library/Application\ Support/Firefox/Profiles/*.default-release
```
